        Understand the Code: - Review the COBOL program thoroughly. Identify the programâ€™s purpose and overall functionality. - If possible, run the code in a test environment and observe how it behaves with sample data. 
	1	State the High-Level Purpose: - Begin by explaining the main goal* of the COBOL program. For instance, is it processing financial transactions, generating reports, or managing records? Clarify what problem or task the code is intended to address. 
	2	Break Down Key Divisions: - COBOL programs typically have four divisions (Identification, Environment, Data, and Procedure). Walk through each section and explain its role:  
	   - Identification Division: What is the program name and purpose as declared here? - Environment Division: Which system configurations and files are used? 
	   - Data Division: Highlight the key data structures (working-storage section, file section). What are the critical files and records the program is working with? 
	   - Procedure Division: Explain the core logic. What steps is the code executing to achieve the goal? 
	3	Explain the Data Flow: - Identify the input files or data the program processes, how the data is read, manipulated, and then written or displayed as output. - Walk through how the data moves through different paragraphs or sections. 
	4	Detail Key Variables and Structures: - Point out important data elements and explain their significance. For example, are there any specific records or fields that the program frequently accesses or modifies? What are the key 88-level conditions? 
	5	Explain Control Flow and Logic: - Explain how the logic is structured. Identify the key PERFORM loops, IF conditions, and any GO TO statements or EXIT points. - Break down major routines or paragraphs and describe their purpose. What are the core processing steps?
	6	Simplify Complex Operations: - For any tricky parts (like advanced file handling, arithmetic calculations, or COBOL-specific constructs), offer a simpler explanation using plain language. What is the intent behind the more complex logic?  
	7	Summarize the Main Functionality: - Conclude by summarizing the key operations and outputs of the code. Mention any risks or areas for improvement related to outdated practices, inefficiencies, or maintainability.
