COBOL Program Documentation

Summary:
1. High-Level Purpose:
   The main goal of the COBOL program "EDI850Processor" is to process input data from a CSV file ("edi850.csv"), validate the records, transform the data, and write the transformed output to another CSV file ("output.csv").

2. Key Divisions:
   - Identification Division: 
     - Program Name: EDI850Processor
     - Purpose: Processing EDI 850 Purchase Order data.
   - Environment Division:
     - System Configurations: Line sequential files for input and output.
     - Files: InputFile ('edi850.csv'), OutputFile ('output.csv').
   - Data Division:
     - Defines the file structures for Input and Output files.
     - Key data elements include purchase order details like order ID, buyer ID, date, item ID, quantity, and unit price.
   - Procedure Division:
     - The core logic is divided into MAIN-PROCEDURE, Validate-Record, and Transform-Record paragraphs.
     - Reads input records, validates them, transforms data, and writes to the output file.

3. Data Flow:
   - Reads input records from 'edi850.csv'.
   - Validates each record's item quantity and unit price.
   - Transforms the record by calculating total price.
   - Writes the transformed record to 'output.csv'.

4. Key Variables and Structures:
   - Important Data Elements: Purchase order details such as Order ID, Buyer ID, Date, Item ID, Quantity, Unit Price.
   - WS-VALID-RECORD: Flag to indicate if a record is valid.
   - WS-EOF-FLAG: Flag to indicate end of file.
   - Calculated field: WS-OutItemTotalPrice calculated based on quantity and unit price.

5. Control Flow and Logic:
   - Uses PERFORM loops to iterate through records until the end of the file.
   - Validates records based on item quantity and unit price.
   - Transforms records by calculating total price and writes the output.
   - Proper use of IF conditions to control flow.
   
6. Complex Operations Simplified:
   - The program reads input data, validates it for negative quantity or price, calculates total price, and writes transformed data to an output file. 

7. Main Functionality Summary:
   The COBOL program processes EDI 850 purchase order data, validates records, calculates total prices, and generates an output file. The program could be improved by adding error handling for different validation scenarios and enhancing readability through more descriptive variable names.
